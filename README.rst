Created by `Cumulus Networks, Inc. <http://www.cumulusnetworks.com/>`_, the Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) Project is a small operating system, pre-installed as firmware on bare metal network switches, that provides an environment for automated operating system provisioning.

This project has moved to the Open Compute Project's git repository.
